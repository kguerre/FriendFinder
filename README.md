# Friend Finder - Node and Express Servers

### Overview

In this activity, I created a compatibility-based "Friend Finder" application using Node and Express servers. Users will answer a few survey questions and instantly find their new best friend with the click of a button. This application takes the survery results from the user and compares them to other the results of other friend seekers. The app displays the name and picture of the most compatible friend match.
